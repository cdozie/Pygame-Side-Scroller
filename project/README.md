Before proceeding with the Project, the first thing that is necessary if you have not done so already is to install the most recent version of Python from here [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Then, after this, if you have not done so already, head to [https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted) to install the most recent version of PyGame for Python as this module is necessary for the running of this program.

Once you have those installed, upon downloading the final project file, unzip it to the location of your choice and proceed to the folder named Nwabuebo\_Chidozie\_CS50FinalProject. In the folder proceed to the file named CS50FinalProjectSideScroller.py. To view the code, you can right click and choose to open it with the IDE of your choice and from there run the code or you can simply double tap the file to run it.

The other folders in the file are within the **Shooter-files** folder and are for the media assets used for this application and for the level data. Audio and image files can be found in the **audio** and **img** folders. The level data are in CSV files within **Shooter-files** simply named **level(number).csv**

Within the program, there are a few controls necessary to learn.

- To click on buttons, navigate to them with your mouse and press down. This will activate the button of your choice and allow you to proceed.
  - The **START** button on the main menu brings you to the select screen on your way to start the game.
  - The **QUIT** button on the main menu exits the program.
  - The player characters in the hero and enemy select screens are buttons so just pick the player character that has the color you desire.
- Once within the game the main controls are:
  - Use the right arrow key to move the player character right.
  - Use the left arrow key to move the player character left
  - Use the up arrow key to make the player character jump
  - Use the space key on your keyboard to shoot your lasers (can either press or hold depending on how you want to play).
  - Use the q key on your keyboard to throw your bombs. (These bombs also damage you if too close so be careful).
- Once you beat a level you can either press the on-screen **CONTINUE** button to move to the next level or the on-screen **MAIN MENU** button to return to the main menu.
- After you beat the final level, you can press the on-screen **MAIN MENU** button to return to the main menu from where you can either start a new game or quit by selecting the on-screen buttons for those operations.
- **\*ON THE MAIN MENU AND WITHIN THE GAME, BOTH THE WINDOW X BUTTON AND THE ESCAPE KEY ON YOUR KEYBOARD TO EXIT THE GAME AT ANY TIME.**
